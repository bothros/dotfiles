22:44 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/k. confused.  what's the purpose of your lookupandreplace() function.  why not just use a petl lookupjoin()?
22:48 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/eh, may have answered my own question.

11:01 c<c5/brianmcfaddengc>c e5/Ok.
13:53 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/better day today?
14:14 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/hah, yeah
14:14 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/Just slowly and carefully documenting stuff
14:14 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/good.
14:14 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/ok. good thanks,
14:15 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/Also, the things that accept multiple inputs as lists, I might switch to accept a dict, because that seems to be the normal way it's done in petl
14:15 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/We're setting up more tables here.  The etl stuff is going to get a lot more use shorlty.
14:16 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/yeah.  Both would be ideal :)
14:16 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/but I hear ya.
14:16 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/I thought the same.  I didn't realize Petl was using dicts in that way already but I thought maybe accepting a dict would be a good move.
14:17 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/Ok, I'll at least switch it to dicts, maybe allow both if that looks easy
14:17 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/ok
17:12 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/sent you an email w/ db updates
17:12 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok
17:17 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/I need to spend a little more time w/ paul here but we're close to being ready to do some petl to load those tables from text files
17:17 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok
17:23 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/familiarize yourself with temp/rea725/etl/extract/crunch_bom.py
17:23 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/Ok.
17:24 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I'm going to get off around 6 to go and get a replacement tire
17:24 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/it does a bunch of stuff, but uses old tables that we don't use anymore.
17:24 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/and, it doesn't use petl.
17:24 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/point is, it has a looper that loops through input text files.
17:24 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok
17:24 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/So we want to make one to load stuff into petl instead?
17:25 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/from the same format?
17:25 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/we'll be looping through similar files (extract) and then transforming them via petl and loading the 3 tables the paul sent us.  yes.
17:25 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok
17:26 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/Are the files paul sent the same format we want to extract, or is there a different format?
17:26 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/different
17:26 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok
17:26 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/sorry. i'm probably not explaining well.
17:27 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/yeah, I'm trying to puzzle it out
17:27 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/there's a bunch of text files that we will load into petl.  transform via petl, and then load into the tables that paul sent us.
17:27 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ah, ok
17:27 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/it'll make more sense when I send you the text files with the data that we'll load.
17:27 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/what format are the text files in?
17:27 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/tab delimited txt.
17:27 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok
17:28 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/will send to u now.
17:28 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/then we probably can just use petl.fromtsv, right?
17:28 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/yeah
17:29 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/Oh, I have documented most of the functions in util.py
17:29 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/If you could look at what I just pushed and let me know if anything is still unclear to you, that would be nice.
17:30 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/did you get a chance to look at the fakepath issue
17:34 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/oh, no I haven't.
17:34 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/Let me take a look at it right now.
17:34 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/If i can't fix it this evening, I'll do it tomorrow.
17:37 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/yep. will do.
17:38 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/I sent you a big pile of text files.  Put them in the input_data folder I describe in the email.
17:38 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/k.  i have a review meeting with BCBSM and that is on the open issues list.  They are getting antsy.
17:38 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/sorry

17:54 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok, my dev server appears to be broken write now
17:54 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/but I've got a fix that should work for the fakepath issue
17:55 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/and I need to go.
17:55 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I'll push it, and you can see if it works, alright?
17:58 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/Just pushed

16:04 c<c5/brianmcfaddengc>c e5/I noticed that cockpit/web and Plaid/web were both updated after they were split.
16:05 c<c5/brianmcfaddengc>c e5/And that they have some different files.
16:05 c<c5/brianmcfaddengc>c e5/So, which files are needed among the two for the new web repo?
16:31 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/most likely cockpit/web
16:31 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/well, what exactly does the new web repo do?
16:32 c<c5/brianmcfaddengc>c e5/Right now, it doesn't do anything.
16:32 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/yeah
16:32 c<c5/brianmcfaddengc>c e5/There is nothing in there.
16:32 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/but what is it supposed to do?
16:33 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/routemessages from the http to apps?
16:33 c<c5/brianmcfaddengc>c e5/That is pretty much all that it will do.
16:33 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/or deal with incoming messages from apps to apps?
16:33 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok
16:33 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/that's probably more like what cockpit/web does
16:33 c<c5/brianmcfaddengc>c e5/Yeah.
16:33 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/plaid/web deals with incoming messages from cockpit
16:33 c<c5/brianmcfaddengc>c e5/What does Plaid/web do?
16:33 c<c5/brianmcfaddengc>c e5/Ok.
16:33 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/because that used http too
16:42 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] should we make a blueprint repo back on inviscid for the time being
16:42 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] so we can get prod updates
16:44 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/we could do that
16:44 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/in fact, yes, I think that's a good idea
16:45 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] ok..it is up
16:45 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/does dan have the most up to date local Blueprint?
16:45 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] y
16:45 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I'd like him to push to the inviscid Blueprint, then I'll pull from it on prod

17:07 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/could you push your Blueprint to inviscid/Blueprint? it's been recreated so we can update prod
17:07 c<c5/danhummongc>c e5/I already did.

17:12 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Dan] Check which branch prod is using for Blueprint. Probably should be master.

17:20 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] I did something cool
17:20 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] https://github.com/PlaidCloud/web/commits/master
17:20 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/and restartAll does clear the cache
17:20 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Dan] ?
17:20 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Dan] 404
17:20 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] I can see it fine.
17:20 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Weird
17:20 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Dan] I can.t
17:21 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Dan] I am logged in.
17:21 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Anyway, the commits in there are from Cockpit.
17:21 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] There is a git subtree-filter command that lets you takes commits from one directory and put them in a new repository.
17:21 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/k
17:21 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Is anybody else having trouble with that repo? I can see all parts of it fine.
17:21 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Dan] Interesting.
17:22 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Paul did just delete what was there a few minutes ago
17:22 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] but I don't know why we would have different results.
17:22 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/urr, 500 error on prod
17:22 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] i can see it
17:22 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] yes
17:22 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/is it inviscid:admin to log in? or is it different?
17:22 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] i recreated a blank repo
17:22 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] oh
17:22 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/ok
17:22 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Shouldn't be empty anymore.
17:23 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Dan] I see it now
17:23 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] It should have the whole history of Cockpit/web.
17:23 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] dan wasn't on the web team
17:23 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] heh
17:23 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] i guess we know team affiliations works to filter access ;)
17:23 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Dan] That's cool. If I'm not on the web team, I guess I'll just collect paychecks for doing nothing.
17:23 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Dan] :-P
17:24 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Buttons-That-Do-Nothing team.
17:24 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/no…i have a different password in prod
17:24 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Dan] Yeah
17:24 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/lemee check
17:24 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Dan] That's a good team
17:24 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I get a 500 when I log in
17:24 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/it could be that that's what it does on a bad log in right now
17:24 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/something in the logs about global name "Members" being undefined
17:25 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/we need a repo for those
17:25 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/crap i can't log in
17:25 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/wouldn't want those to get out of date
17:25 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok, same error
17:26 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/crap
17:26 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/trying to figure it out now
17:26 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] For example, if it started doing something, that would be a major problem.
17:27 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Dan] We'll need a new type of automated testing to make sure nothing happens when buttons are clicked.
17:28 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/do you know where an object name Members might be used?
17:28 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Who moved Plaid/web to Cockpit/web in the first place? Because there is more history here than I thought there would be.
17:28 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/login most likely.  probably in cockpit
17:29 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/it has to be in cockpit, cannot be in plaid, or the error would have showed up in a different log
17:29 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] when we broke it apart the web part went with cockpit
17:29 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/y
17:29 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/k.  lemme look
17:29 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/places it's not: auth.py, passwordhash.py
17:30 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] I was just wondering who did it, because he preserved the history from when it was in Plaid.
17:30 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/profile.py
17:30 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/probably me
17:30 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/login.py
17:30 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Cool. Thanks. I was worried that the code had just been copied.
17:30 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/Cockpit basically started as a clone of Plaid if I remember right
17:30 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/then we modified both of them until they were what they were supposed to be
17:31 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] That is how the process that I used began, too.
17:31 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/auth.py…although you said that wasn't it
17:31 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] There was a long StackOverflow post on how to do it.
17:31 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/identity.py
17:31 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/it isn't mentioned in there on the prod server
17:31 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/Are you sure you're looking at master on cockpit?
17:31 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] But maybe the pruning process got rid of everything not web-related.
17:31 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/also what directories are these in?
17:31 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] A regular git clone would have preserved the history as well.
17:32 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/cockpit/core/security/auth.py should have from cockpit.model.identity.identity import Members
17:32 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ah ok
17:33 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I was looking at cockpit/app/cockpit/layout/auth.py
17:34 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/looks like maybe in login.py
17:34 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/Members isn't imported at the top, but it's mentioned in __send_locked_email
17:35 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/PlaidGroupMembers is imported and is also used
17:35 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/are these two different names for the same thing?
17:35 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/they are different
17:35 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok
17:36 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I'll add that to the import on prod
17:36 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/i see the same problem here.  wonder why it isn't erroring here
17:36 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I don't think that's it, as I doubt __send_locked_email is being called
17:36 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I think the same problem will exist in another file
17:36 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/actually, could you fix it on yours and then push?
17:37 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/y
17:38 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/k. pushed to master
17:39 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/We really need a qa step. Getting that into the process needs to be near the top of the to-do list for the next time we aren't in crunch time
17:39 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/oh, what's your password, or you can test logging in.
17:40 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/just tell me the result so I can check the log
17:40 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/yes.  i did qa test it on my machine
17:40 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/still and error
17:40 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/different error
17:40 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/type object 'PlaidGroupMembers' has no attribute 'UserName'
17:40 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/so it's definitely in that file
17:41 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I believe it's tryinhg to send you an e-mail
17:41 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/*trying
17:41 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/k…just a sec
17:42 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/k.  i fixed that.  my bad login count was at 21.  that is certainly worthy of a bug
17:43 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/pushed yet?
17:43 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/oh…it was a database change
17:43 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ah, ok
17:43 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/just zeroed out the count
17:44 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/were you able to log in to prod?
17:44 c<c5/paulmorelgc>c e5/y
17:44 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok
17:44 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/great
17:44 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Was cockpit/containers/ui.py merged with plaidcloud-python/plaidcloud/container.py?
17:45 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/yes, fairly recently
17:45 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] ok.
17:45 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/plaidcloud/container.py should be able to do everything ui.py does, but cockpit hasn't been updated to use it instead, everywhere
17:46 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Ok.
17:46 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/plaid has been using plaidcloud/container.py for a while now
17:46 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Ok.
17:48 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] What is the rest container?
17:49 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] I know it was supposed to be for non-UI REST requests originally, but our UI requests became REST requests, and rest.py was updated recently, so I am doubting that that is what it was used for.
17:49 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Also, we don't have anything else besides UI access.
17:50 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/container.py basically just deals with the plaidcloud api
17:50 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I'm not sure what rest.py does
17:50 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/where is it?
17:51 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] https://github.com/PlaidCloud/cockpit/blob/master/web/containers/rest.py
17:51 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I've never seen this before, you'll have to ask paul
17:51 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] It's 100% Paul project.
17:51 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] So I guess he'll have to weigh in.
17:51 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] i wouldn't sweat that one.  we do not have any rest access at the moment
17:51 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Ok.
17:51 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] just delete for now
17:52 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Just wondering if I should remove it from the new web repo.
17:52 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] yes
17:52 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] fewer classes that don't work
17:52 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/since starting to use git, I've become very aggressive in deleting unused code
17:54 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] yeah.
17:55 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] I just thought it was used, since it was updated in March.
17:55 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] You can always get it back.
17:55 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] there are some menu items missing in prod.  I have to step away for a bit but I'll be back to troubleshoot later
17:55 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ugh
17:56 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/is your qa machine loading definitions from disk or from s3?
17:57 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] i thought i pushed everything to S3 but I will need to check
17:57 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/let me check what prod's loading from
17:57 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] could be the cache wasn't blown away
17:57 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] gotta run
17:57 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] bbl
17:57 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok, looks like prod is getting from s3
17:57 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/will check the cache
17:58 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/cya
17:59 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/s3cache was sitting there, I don't know if it was new or old
17:59 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I removed it
18:47 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/yt
18:53 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/updated an issue that you closed.  Please incorporate 'truncate' as we discussed earlier today to empty staging tables prior to running the remainder of code in test case in extract_lxm_sample_data.py
18:53 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok, sure
18:53 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/thx.
18:54 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/i was able to run it by manually purging db records but didn't build it in.
18:54 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/did you reopen the issue?
18:55 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I see you did
18:55 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok
19:00 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/are you going to be available later?
19:01 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/up until a certain point, maybe. I'm exhausted, and I'm also going to call Yelena later.
19:23 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/yo

19:39 c<c5/spacemonkey8999gc>c e5/i am
19:39 c<c5/spacemonkey8999gc>c e5/what one is best to start with?
19:39 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/...really hard to say
19:39 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/MC book, maybe, if you're trying to analyze it
19:40 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/it's meant to be played without reading it first
19:40 c<c5/spacemonkey8999gc>c e5/i started with the both file
19:40 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/yeah
19:40 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I found it useful to play through a sample game in my head, with two of them open
19:40 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/...actually, you know what?
19:40 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/how would you feel about playing it now, over interwubs?
19:40 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I think I have the energy
19:41 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I would certainly if you played the MC side
19:41 c<c5/spacemonkey8999gc>c e5/i do not have the time unfortunetly
19:41 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/aww
19:41 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/you've got something to do in less than an hour?
19:41 c<c5/spacemonkey8999gc>c e5/yeah, video chatting with Amy in a bit
19:41 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ah, yeah
19:41 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/so
19:42 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/tangentially related
19:42 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/do you know of a site that's like graham walmsley's dice roller, but for playing cards?
19:42 c<c5/spacemonkey8999gc>c e5/i do not
19:46 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/maybe I could extend his
19:51 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/man, how can this not already exist
19:51 c<c5/spacemonkey8999gc>c e5/I'm not here right now
19:51 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/this is the most obvious idea
19:51 c<c5/spacemonkey8999gc>c e5/make one?
19:51 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/yeah, I don't want to though
19:51 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I might anyway
19:52 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I don't want to write a server for it, though
19:52 c<c5/spacemonkey8999gc>c e5/that is true
19:53 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/found one that doesn't share between multiple clients

21:21 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/okay
22:29 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[20:23:59] [Paul] crap.  we need to add the import, export, and delete loops to supervisord
22:29 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[22:22:10] [Paul] WTF is the deal with this supervisord shit.  I can't get anything to run in prod.  I updated what I thought was the referenced supervisord.conf file but the profit modules are not being run.
22:29 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[22:23:27] [Brian] I can try to help, but I'm unfamiliar with changes that have been made since we left EC2.
22:29 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[22:24:06] [Brian] How can I SSH to prod?
22:29 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[22:24:44] [Paul] ssh docpaction@50.28.62.217
22:29 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[22:25:02] [Brian] Oh yeah… Dan added our SSH keys.
22:31 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/@Brian, have you been able to make sense of it?
22:32 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/@Paul, is it the cart parsing exporting and deleting that you want, or the profit?
22:32 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] My best guess is that it's using a file somewhere else.
22:32 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] profit.  the cart seems to be running as usual
22:32 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] I'm seeing if I can see the configuration file with supervisorctl.
22:32 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/it only mensions the profit ones in the supervisord.conf I see on the server
22:32 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] supervisorctl shows that it is only even trying to run deleting, exporting, parsing, and plaid.
22:33 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] i just replaced the conf file with a new one and restarted
22:33 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] I tried doing that.
22:33 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] but it does not appear to reference it
22:33 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/where is this new one?
22:34 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] /etc/supervisord.conf
22:34 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/this is definitely going to fail
22:34 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/there's no cockpit on this server, for one thing
22:35 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/and I believe plaid should be on port 8891
22:35 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] crap.  i copied that from my local install
22:35 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/yeah
22:35 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/prod doesn't work like the local installs
22:35 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Still, it doesn't seem to be that supervisord.conf.
22:36 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/yeah, it sounds like it's still running the old one
22:38 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] When I use -c /etc/supervisord.conf, I get this message

22:38 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] I wish supervisord told me which file it was using.
22:38 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/that's to be expected
22:38 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/the new supervisord.conf is wrong for prod
22:39 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I'm going to edit it to be correct
22:39 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] I still want to know what it's using.
22:39 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] ok
22:39 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] supervisor should not be running right now
22:40 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok, I've fixed supervisord.conf
22:40 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/if we just want to make it work, you could try it with -c /etc/supervisord.conf again

22:41 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Strangely enough, that's using the service command.
22:41 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Without -c.

22:41 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I'll make that change
22:41 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] ok
22:41 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/is there anywhere else we need python2.7?
22:42 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I know petl requires it
22:42 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Not that I can think of.
22:42 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok, go ahead and try again
22:42 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/oh
22:43 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/yeah, it should be fine
22:43 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I believe all the code that specifically references a location checks to see if 2.7 exists, and if not uses 2.6

22:44 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] I found a new place where we need Python2.7

22:45 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Uh oh.

22:46 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] geez
22:46 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Probably faster than creating a new machine.
22:46 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] y
22:47 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] no time for that.  this has to be running tonight.  i'm at BCBSM in the morning and this has to be working by then
22:47 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Yeah.
22:47 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok
22:47 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/Brian, do you want to set up this ordereddict substitute or should I?
22:48 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] I started working on it now.
22:48 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/kk
22:48 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/let me know if you need anything
22:48 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] What repo is that stuff in?
22:48 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] I guess Plaid
22:48 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/yeah
22:48 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] y
22:48 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] profit branch?
22:48 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] or master?
22:48 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] or prod?
22:49 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/prod branch
22:49 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] prod
22:49 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] ok
22:49 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/in general, our system requirements should be ubuntu 12.04 now
22:50 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] yes.  we need to get migrated
22:51 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Should I make the changes in github first or just hotpatch on the server?
22:51 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] The changes are going to be pretty small.
22:51 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/hotpatch
22:51 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] k
22:51 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/these changes don't really apply to anything else
22:51 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] y
22:53 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] we can actually spin up another app server and replace this one.  The cockpit server is more problematic since the PlaidCloud DNS entry points to it.
22:53 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/We can do that, but I think this hotpatch will work
22:53 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] y…not for tonight
22:54 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] ok
22:55 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] looks like the entry in the queue is gone now
22:55 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] status… running
22:55 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] k..lemme make sure the import kicks off correctly
22:56 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] ok
22:57 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Yeah, I don't think these fixes should even be in the git history.
22:57 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] It's like the hottest patch of all time.
23:00 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Uptime is still (roughly) the same for all processes.
23:01 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] ok.  you should see the parsing running now on the server
23:02 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] it appears to be running form the progress bar
23:02 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] INFO:__main__:42320313/54961426 bytes parsed (77%).
23:02 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/INFO:__main__:42869935/54961426 bytes parsed (78%).
23:02 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] yeah.
23:03 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] ok.  that part appears to work now.  i think the other problems I'm seeing are data related
23:03 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] There were some exceptions, but it looks like they were caught and dealt with
23:04 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Uptime is still progressing.
23:04 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] "No row was found for one()"
23:04 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] y.  i have some errors in the interface right now
23:04 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Let me know any way that I can help.
23:05 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] this appears to be strictly data
23:09 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] we have to stop requiring this type of heroics for production updates.  This update has taken since Friday to complete.  clearly not sustainable.
23:10 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Yeah.
23:10 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] Well, we need a qa server in Storm.
23:10 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] y
23:10 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] full qa infrastructure
23:20 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/What's still not working?
23:24 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] just data issues at the moment.  plus there are some quirky cosmetic things that need to get addressed.  gonna be a lot of bug fixes coming I'm sure.
23:24 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok
23:24 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/is there likely to be something I can do tonight?
23:25 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] no.  i'm done.  i have an early flight in the morning
23:25 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok
23:25 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I'm going to bed then
23:25 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] it is working as good as its going to for tomorrow
23:25 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/good night
23:25 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] See ya.
23:25 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] thx guys
23:25 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/sure
23:26 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Brian] No problem… unfortunate that it is not 100% good.

22:18 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] gun fire in downtown right now.  must be lousy shots with all the rounds expended.
22:18 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Mike] sheesh.
22:19 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Mike] 70 years of progressivism
22:19 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] i'm not getting dragged in tonight
22:19 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Mike] :)
22:19 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Mike] fair enough
22:21 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Mike] how many rounds?
22:21 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] geez.  must have been over 20
22:21 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Mike] good grief. scary.
22:21 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] well maybe it was only 18 if it was a glock
22:22 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] or they could have reloaded
22:22 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Mike] heh
22:22 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Mike] I'd like to have a glock.
22:22 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Mike] buddy has one, I fired it at a range last winter.
22:22 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Mike] no.  not a glock.  it was a sig.  very nice.
22:23 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] y…i like my sig.  glocks never felt right to me
22:23 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Mike] yeah, the sig was nice.  I really don't have a basis for comparison though.
22:24 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Mike] my 22s don't count.
22:24 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] i carried a baretta for many years in the army.  MUCH prefer the sig.
22:25 c<c5/lelamelilagc>c e5/everything all right?
22:25 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/yeah
22:26 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I spilled some water
22:26 c<c5/lelamelilagc>c e5/rats, I feared that was what it was
22:26 c<c5/lelamelilagc>c e5/on your keyboard?
22:26 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/not quite
22:26 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/but I had to move my laptop
22:26 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/and disconnected my camera
22:26 c<c5/lelamelilagc>c e5/ok
22:26 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I may have to restart the call
22:26 c<c5/lelamelilagc>c e5/that's fine
22:26 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I'm going to if you don't mind
22:27 c<c5/piratesgc>c e5/[Paul] i also really like my 1911A1 but that is serious old school
22:27 c<c5/lelamelilagc>c e5/sure
22:27 c<c5/lelamelilagc>c e5/do you want me to forward you my flight confirmation?
22:27 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/sure
22:27 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/it made a noise but it's a blank white screen
22:33 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/Adams!
22:33 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/you're available!
22:33 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/I have much to discuss with you!
22:37 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I'm only a little available
22:37 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I'm on a video call with yelena right now
22:38 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/oh
22:38 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I'm sorry
22:38 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I could probably talk during the day tomorrow
22:38 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/great!
22:39 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/Yelena says to tell you:
22:39 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/"The japanese restaurant you mentioned sounds great"
22:39 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/"And I will get back to you soon"
22:39 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/awesome. It is great. Tell her that she can go ahead and buy tickets for an o'hare bus stop
22:40 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/I don't want them to run out on her again
22:41 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/She says "It's my own fault for leaving it until this week to check"
22:42 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/yeah, but I'd do the same thing, so I'm sympathetic
22:44 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/near o'hare will be perfect, actually. I could stop in the airport to feed. 
22:44 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/(you don't have to tell her that last part)
22:44 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/unless she'd be comfortable hearing it
22:44 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/already did, verbatim
22:44 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/oh
22:44 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/she was, because she didn't quite parse what I said
22:45 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/she probabloy would be otherwise, but I don't want to get into a conversation with her about it right now
22:45 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/so
22:45 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/okay
22:45 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/thanks!
22:45 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I just teased her that we're talking about her
22:45 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/let her think I said "pee" instead of "feed"
22:45 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/haha
22:46 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I'm supposed to tell you that I'm horrible.
22:46 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/well, I think you're both great, so I don't see where this "horrible" is coming from
22:47 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/well, my teasing her about talking about her, and not telling her what we're saying
22:47 c<c5/sobeknefretgc>c e5/ah
22:49 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/how's it going?
22:53 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/pretty well
22:54 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/ok. good to know.
22:55 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/the next step will be trickier than this one was.  I'm figuring out how to go about it now.
22:55 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ok
22:55 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/It's ok to just tell me what the result needs to be like, and not the steps to accomplish it, unless thinking about the steps helps you to think about what the result needs to be
22:56 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/If that makes sense
22:56 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/yeah,,,sometimes it's easier to go through the steps in my brain., based on how I'd build it if we were going to do it w/ database queries.
22:56 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ah, ok
22:57 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/plus, you've seen my tendency to be verbose w/ variable names.  Makes it easier for me to decipher if/when I revisit code down the road
22:57 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/yeah
22:59 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/I tend to lean to the extreme on that end of things, because I've been burnt (mostly by myself) for doing things like methods called do().  Not very useful in retrospect.  Python doesn't penalize for long names as I understand.
22:59 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/ha, yeah
22:59 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/it doesn't
22:59 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/PEP8 does, though
22:59 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/with the 80 character line limit
22:59 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/yeah, we sorta do most of pep8, but bend on that part:)
23:00 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/yeah
23:00 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/I find that that limit is good to follow most of the time
23:00 c<c1/bothrosgc>c e1/but when your code is supposed to look like a table, it should look like a table
23:00 c<c5/michaelreagc>c e5/yep.
